// The ONE status→colour map (design brief: "Status is the canonical state palette ... one system-
// owned palette expresses lifecycle state for EVERY stateful entity"). Every card, row, badge, chip,
// and score marker in the product renders lifecycle state by asking THIS module for a class — never
// by picking a colour inline. NOTES UI1: before this module existed, `active` rendered grey on the
// Studio project card and the project page's work-unit rows (both hand-picked `.chip.is-progress`,
// a plain-neutral class with no relationship to the palette) while the run-view score rail correctly
// rendered it blue (`.snode.active`) — three renderers, three independent colour decisions for the
// same word. A status colour is now impossible to set locally: every call site converts its own
// domain status (`WorkUnitStatus`, `ArtifactStatus`, a score node's `NodeState`) through the
// `fromXxx` functions below into one of the seven `CanonicalStatus` values, then asks `chipClass`/
// `dotClass`/`snodeClass` for the marker-family-appropriate class — the class SPELLING still varies
// by marker shape (a `.chip`, a `.dot`, a `.snode` each have their own historical CSS vocabulary),
// but the DECISION ("which of the seven states is this, and what colour does that state get") is
// made exactly once, here, for the whole product.
//
// "blocked" deliberately does NOT render red: the design brief's canonical palette states "blocked =
// solid neutral gray plus an explicit label (never orange — orange near brass is forbidden)" — red is
// reserved for `failed` (a content-level rejection), never a stalled-but-recoverable state. Gate
// brass (`needs-you`) is scarce by construction: it is the only canonical status this module ever
// hands out that uses the amber/brass family, and nothing outside a gate ever asks for it.
