// The Orchestrator's system prompt (docs/orchestrator-prompt.md, the Conductor-authored voice) is
// loaded from disk VERBATIM — read once, passed to the SDK's `systemPrompt` option unmodified, never
// edited or appended to. `narrate()` sends the already-computed factual line as the user turn under
// that system prompt so the model phrases it in the Orchestrator's voice. `interpret()` uses the
// SDK's native `outputFormat: {type: "json_schema"}` (confirmed in the shipped sdk.d.ts) instead of
// asking the model to hand-format JSON in prose — the same verbatim system prompt still applies (its
// own §"Intent to operations" already describes translating free text "through your tools"; a JSON
// schema constraint is the mechanical realization of that, not a prompt edit).
